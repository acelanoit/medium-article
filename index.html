    <h2>"Time spent with cats is never wasted."</h2>
    <p>
      Cats have a specialized collarbone: Unlike humans and many other mammals, cats have a unique collarbone that isn't
      directly connected to their other bones. This allows them to fit through small spaces and makes them extremely
      flexible. It's why cats can squeeze into tight spots or contort their bodies in seemingly impossible ways.

    <h2>"Cats choose us; we don't own them."</h2>
    <p>
      Cats have a distinct purr: Cats are known for their purring, which is often associated with contentment and
      relaxation. However, what's interesting is that cats can also purr when they're in pain or distress. Scientists
      believe that purring may have a healing effect on their bodies, as the vibrations can help stimulate bone
      regeneration and alleviate pain.

    <h2>"The smallest feline is a masterpiece."</h2>
    <p>
      Cats have a keen sense of balance: Cats are renowned for their remarkable balance and agility. They have an
      incredible ability to land on their feet, even from great heights. This is due to their flexible backbone and
      inner ear, which work together to help them maintain their equilibrium. They can twist their bodies mid-air and
      adjust their position to ensure a safe landing, earning them the reputation of being natural acrobats.
